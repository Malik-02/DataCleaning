# DataCleaning
In this project, I performed data cleaning on a dataset derived from the 'Craft Beer Bar Sales' Kaggle dataset. The goal was to prepare the data for further analysis by ensuring it adhered to a defined schema and was free from inconsistencies and errors. The key steps involved:

Reading the dataset and inspecting its columns.
Removing columns not included in the data dictionary.
Identifying and removing attributes with only a single unique value.
Comparing columns to identify and remove duplicates.
Detecting and removing duplicate rows.
Displaying basic statistical information for numeric attributes.
Identifying and handling erroneous zero values in the 'Retail_price' attribute.
Creating and inspecting box plots for 'Size' and 'ABV' to identify outliers.
Calculating the Interquartile Range (IQR) to determine outlier thresholds and displaying the rows containing outliers.
Considering whether to impute values for outliers and providing a rationale for each attribute.
Determining the number of missing values in each column and removing rows with more than three missing values.
This systematic approach ensured that the dataset was cleaned and ready for accurate and meaningful analysis.
